### AWS cloud
**Region**: The geographical area where your resources are hosted.

**VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account for isolated cloud resources.
### Amazone EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.

### User interaction
**HTTP Requests**: Users interact with the deployed application via HTTP.
### DockerHub
**Docker Image**: The EC2 instance pulls the required Docker image from DockerHub as part of the deployment process.
